## Initialization
To initialize service and prepare dev environment, firstly you need to get `schema.prisma` file. To generate it, run all services from the root directory:
```bash
yarn services:dev:run
```
and then, from recommender service directory `services/recommender`, run:
```bash
yarn initialize
```
